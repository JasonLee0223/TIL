# Use Terminology Well (적절한 부분에 기술용어 잘 사용하기)
>**Term of Art**   
noun - a word or phrase that has a precise, specialized meaning within a particular field or profession.

- >**Avoid obscure terms** if a more common word conveys meaning just as well.   
    Don't say "epidermis" if "skin" will serve your purpose.   
    Terms of art are an essential communication tool,   
    but should only be used to capture crucial meaning that would otherwiser be lost.

- >**Stick to the established meaning** if you do use a term of art.   

- >**Avoid abbreviations.**   
    Abbreviations, especially non-standard ones, are effectively terms-of-art, because understanding depends on correctly translating them into their non-abbreviated forms.
        
    > The intended meaning for any abbreviation you use should be easily found by a web search.

- >**Embrace precedent.**   
    Don't optimize terms for the total beginner at the expense of conformance to existing culture.
